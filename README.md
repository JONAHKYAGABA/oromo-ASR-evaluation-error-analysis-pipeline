# oromo-ASR-evaluation-error-analysis-pipeline
Oromo ASR Evaluation &amp; Error Analysis Pipeline This project provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and analyzing the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models on Oromo speech data. It includes WER/CER computation, error categorization, preprocessing enhancements, and vocabulary diagnostics.
Features
🧠 Model Evaluation using Hugging Face Transformers pipeline

📊 Metric Computation: Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), substitutions, insertions, and deletions

🔁 Vocabulary Diagnostics: Preprocessing and remapping of problematic characters

🔍 Error Pattern Analysis: Frequent n-gram errors and contextual insights

📚 Training Data Comparison: Checks whether ASR errors appear in training vocabulary
